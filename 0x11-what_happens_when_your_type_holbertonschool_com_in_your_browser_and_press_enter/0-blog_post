Title:

Click-bait: Ace your Next SE Interview with This One Weird Trick! Processing URL Requests

Introduction

`What happens when you type a URL in your browser and press Enter?` This is a common interview question used to assess a candidate's web stack knowledge. Many software engineering candidates struggle with this concept, myself included.

DNS request

The Domain Name Server (DNS) is a collection of hundreds of root servers scattered around the world, each server containing info that points every domain request to an IP address. Because looking up the domain and IP address takes significant time, your browser will often save the lookup in the form of a cache stored on your local browser. Four caches are checked in this order:

1. Browser cache
2. Operating System cache
3. Router cache
4. ISP DNS cache

In this way, the first time you check out a new website, the lookup may be slow. However, all domain requests after the first lookup, the lookup will be noticeably fast.

TCP/IP

TCP/IP is named after the acronyms from two protocols used for Internet communications: the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP). However, the term TCP/IP uses more than these two protocols. TCP/IP uses the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) as well as the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). They are all standards for network communications.

In the context of searching for a URL, TCP is used to deliver a stream of bytes, the URL, from your local computer, to the hosts on the IP network. TCP establishes a connection between the client and server. IP relays datagrams across network boundaries. IP addresses host interfaces while TCP is responsible for the actual transportation of data over physical space. When the URL datagram reaches the DNS, the Internet Protocol is used to interface with the DNS so that it can accept the request.

Conclusion
It's often a good idea to ask your interviewer on what part would they like you to focus on.
