2032 Apocalypse Postmortem

- Users experienced a blackout of all electronic services including our own.
- Hardware for all of humanity was replaced over the course of ten years.
- Timeline
    - 4/20/2022
        - An EMP from an unknown source wipes out all communication.
    - 4/21/2022
        - Panic ensues. All stores were raided in 24 hours. A black market has formed with the CIA as the suspected mafia. Not a single roll of toilet paper can be found on store shelves.
    - 4/23/2022
        - Civil unrest breaks out across the nation. Citizens resort to selling their toilet paper as a form of currency in exchange for food.
    - 4/27/2022
        - Cannibalism is not uncommon as food stocks dry up. Those still buying toilet paper are complaining of sizable bites taken out of their toilet paper.
    - 5/20/2022
        - A new world order has been established by the Californian government. Due to in-fighting, the production of toilet paper has stalled to a stalemate between the toilet paperists (those who believe the production of toilet paper should be top priority) and the washer buttists (those who believe the production of toilet paper can wait in favor of more pressing economic needs like the iphone 14 AND instead of producing toilet paper, we should simply wash our butts with soap and water in the bathtub).
    - 7/20/2022
        - Toilet paper production has been running smoothly for the first week of returning to normal operation. Toilet paper demand has plummeted, however, due to the majority of Americans wiping their butts with soap and water. It seems the toilet paper mania has subsided due to new cultural values.
    - 10/20/2022
        - Toilet paper is merely a memory now. Toilet paper production has halted simply because it's no longer in use. Due to the lack of toilet paper sales, excess toilet paper was air-dropped to developing nations all across the world.
    - 4/20/2022
        - One year after the disaster, society has returned mostly back to normal. Though many key industries were disrupted across the globe, demand was offset by the 100 million lives lost over the course of last year. The death toll, unfortunately, were mostly related to various rectal diseases caused by not wiping one's posterior.
    - 4/20/2027
        - Due to an economic boom, toilet paper, once a relic of the past, has once again made a resurgence in demand, slowly but surely.
    - 4/20/2032
        - Toilet paper demand has returned to normal pre-EMP levels. All servers and electronics in the entire world have been replaced at this point in time. Company employees no longer have any excuses for not coming to work. We can continue selling large-scale EMP missiles again.
